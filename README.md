### Data Sources

This Cyclistic bikeshare data was provided by the Cyclistic bikeshare company through the Google analytics capstone project.

### Tools 

- Microsoft Excel - Data cleaning, Analysis, visualization.
- Microsoft Word - Task deliverabel report.

### Data Cleaning

Before diving into analyzing the data, the most important step is cleaning the data. I did this by;
- Filtering the data to remove blanks.
- Changed the data types.
- Removed columns that wont be useful to my analysis.
- Added columns that would be useful for my analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

This involves exploring the data to answer this question
1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Findings

-	Member riders use bikes more on weekdays than on weekends, while casual riders use bikes mostly on weekends than on weekdays.
-	The average weekly ride length for casual riders is more than the average weekly ride length for member riders.
-	Riders use the bikeshare program based on the seasons which means that total rides in winter are significantly lower than total rides in summer, fall and autumn. The season with the highest rides is summer which happens to be in the months of July and August.
-	Member riders make up 60% of the total annual rides while casual riders make up 40% of total annual rides.
-	Member riders use only classic and electric bikes while casual riders use classic bikes, electric bikes and docked bikes.

### Recommendations

From my analysis and key findings, I would recommend the following;
-	Cyclistics bike share company can organize competitions for all its member only with very attractive prizes. This can draw the attention and interest of casual riders.
-	I would recommend proposing membership discounts to casual riders so as to encourage them to subscribe to membership.
-	Do social media adverts like posting videos and photos, showing all the benefit of being a member or subscribing to membership. The benefits could be randomly selecting members and sending them treats like t-shirts, home equipment or gadgets. This offers will draw the attention of casual riders, encouraging them to subscribe for membership.

### Limitations
- The data was very large and difficult to filter and remove blanks
- My microsoft excel crashed so many times and had to use a different computer to complete my analysis
- I had electricity issues which increased the time i had to finish this project.
